# What is this?

This is a highly **EXPERIMENTAL** server to support Gombot, a tool
that securely remembers your passwords for you.

# Deploy site changes
If you're on the Identity team, simply clone this repo then add a new remote repo:

    git remote add tobmog app@dev.tobmog.org:git

and push your changes:

    git push tobmog HEAD:master

and you're done.

# Update addons
Coming soon. Push code to the skycrane repo and have the addons automagically packaged and released on the site.
